Project Management
==================
Planned Milestones
-----------------------

Week| Planned Targets | Planned Time | Milestones | Actual time
--- | --- | --- | --- | ---
1| Plan out weekly targets and decide how to begin making the compiler. <br>Have a rough plan of key features like what data structures to use, lexer and parser formats and register use | 5 ~ 10 hrs | Modifying code from Lab 2 to print to the output assembly code file. (Lead by Edward),<br> Adding initial set of syntax and grammar. (Lead by Mubaarak) | 10 hrs
2| Have a lexer and parser that can print out basic things in pseudocode like format to the required output| 10 ~ 15 hrs | A test script to compile and run on a single file to help us debug and get our compiler started. Initially used as a console log, to help build the parser for more complicated parts such as functions, arguments and variable/register allocation. (Lead by Edward)<br>Creating a register mapping system and hashtable to keep track of variables. (Lead by Mubaarak) | 15 hrs
3| A compiler that can print out basic machine code and pass at least 1 of the test cases | 10 ~ 15 hrs | Complete parsing of functions and simple maths operations into a tree. Implementing the code generation for functions and operations. (Lead by Edward)<br>Modifying the parser to be able to pass more arguments down to help with code generation and implementing the return syntax. (Lead by Mubaarak)<br>Passed our first set of tests! | 5 hrs
4| Implementing as much of the C language into the compiler with the rest of the time we have left | 20 hrs | Implementing more syntax and grammar:<br>-Edward:<br>Bitwise operators, if/else, while, function calls<br>-Mubaarak:<br>Logical operators | ~
